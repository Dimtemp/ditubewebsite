Today I published an update to my PowerShell Quick Reference: it&#8217;s now updated to PowerShell v3. I tried to include most notable new features of PowerShell v3 in the limited space of my Quick Reference. I really try to keep it a 2-page Quick Ref. It contains a complete new section on PowerShell v3 technology, like new modules, PowerShell web access, and improvements on the ISE. Also, I reformatted the Quick Ref to match with the Code Coloring in the ISE.

**[Get the new Quick Ref here](http://www.dimensionit.tv/powershell-quick-reference)

Please drop me a note on any comments, suggestions, etc&#8230; you might have, and I will happily incorporate it in a new version.

Have fun!  
Dimitri
