It&#8217;s official! Since the start of my new website and blog I had 1024 visitors in the first month! Thanks to everyone that left a nice comment or sent me a message by e-mail or Linked In. A lot of people downloaded the PowerShell Quick Reference. I hope it helps them with their first PowerShell encouter.

Some statistics:

  * The PowerShell Quick Reference has been **downloaded 500 times!**
  * Bing is responsible for 30% of the visitors finding my website by a search engine (so **Bing works!**).
  * 30% of all the visitors is from the United States.
  * I had two visitors from Vietnam. I have been there only one time, so let&#8217;s hope I can even that one out, one time&#8230; ðŸ˜‰

A lot more is coming: **several other Quick References** are in the making. You can expect a lot more blog posts and **even videos**. So maken sure you check out www.dimensionit.tv often.

Did you know you can **subscribe to the <a title="Dimension IT TV RSS feed" href="http://www.dimensionit.tv/feed/" target="_blank">RSS feed</a>?**

Hope to see you soon!

Dimitri
