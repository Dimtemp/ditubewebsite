Hi All,

Celebrating my first post on my new web site, let&#8217;s provide you with my ultimate PowerShell Quick Reference! I just finished work on my latest version of the PowerShell Quick Reference. You can grab a copy and use it as a reference when creating your PowerShell scripts. The document contains a lot of information I got when using PowerShell myself and teaching PowerShell at Microsoft Learning partners sites like Global Knowledge, Compu&#8217;Train, Twice, New Horizons and Centric.

**Download here: [PowerShell Quick Reference Dimension IT](http://www.dimensionit.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/PowerShell-quick-reference-Dimension-IT-v3.03.pdf)  
**  
Please send me a message and let me know what you think of the PowerShell Quick Reference.

_**Update 22 ocotber 2012: Quick Ref updated to PowerShell v3!  
**_  
Today I published an update to my PowerShell Quick Reference: it&#8217;s now updated to PowerShell v3. I tried to include most notable new features of PowerShell v3 in the limited space of my Quick Reference. I really try to keep it a 2-page Quick Ref. It contains a complete new section on PowerShell v3 technology, like new modules, PowerShell web access, and improvements on the ISE. Also, I reformatted the Quick Ref to match with the Code Coloring in the ISE.

Please drop me a note on any comments, suggestions, etc&#8230; you might have, and I will happily incorporate it in a new version.

Have fun!  
Dimitri
