Studying for SQL exam 70-432? Make sure you take training 6231 **AND 6232**. The Microsoft website doesn&#8217;t mention the 6432 training:

<http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?id=70-432#tab3>

When you take a look at the learning plan (mentioned on the same webpage) you will find that Microsoft recommends both 6431 and 6432 courses.

The 6432 training contains information on partitioning, triggers, stored procedures, etc. If you&#8217;re only following the 6431 training you&#8217;ll miss a lot of valuable information to pass the exam!

You can also prepare for the exam by studying this book: MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-432): Microsoft® SQL Server® 2008 &#8211; Implementation and Maintenance. This should contain all the information required to pass the exam.

Good luck!

Dimitri
