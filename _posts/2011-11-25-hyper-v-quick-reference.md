Hi all,

I just finished work on my all-new Hyper-V Quick Reference. It contains a lot of information I got when using and implementing Hyper-V and teaching it at Microsoft Learning Partners like Global Knowledge, Compu’Train, Twice, New Horizons and Centric. Although this document is best used as a quick reference in practice, it can also be used as a great preparation for Exam **70-659** TS: Windows Server 2008 R2, Server Virtualization.

Please send me a message and let me know what you think of the Hyper-V Quick Reference. You can contact me with questions, remarks, etc regarding this document. Join me on Linked in and Facebook to receive valuable information regarding PowerShell, SCOM, SQL Server and Virtualization.

Get the Hyper-V Quick Reference here: [Hyper-V Quick Reference v2-00](http://www.dimensionit.tv/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Hyper-V-Quick-Reference-v2-00.pdf)
